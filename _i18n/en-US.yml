  syntax:
    name: Syntax
    description: >
      Crystal’s syntax is heavily inspired by Ruby’s, so it feels natural to read and easy to write, and has the
      added benefit of a lower learning curve for experienced Ruby devs.

  type_system:
    name: Type System
    description: >
      Crystal is statically type checked, so any type errors will be caught early by the compiler rather than fail on runtime.
      Moreover, and to keep the language clean, Crystal has built-in type inference, so most type annotations are unneeded.

  null_reference:
    name: Null reference checks
    description:
      p: >
        All types are non-nilable in Crystal, and nilable variables are represented as a union between the type and nil.
        As a consequence, the compiler will automatically check for null references in compile time, helping prevent the dreadful billion-dollar mistake.

  macros:
    name: Macros
    description: >
      Crystal’s answer to metaprogramming is a powerful macro system, which ranges from basic templating and AST
      inspection, to types inspection and running arbitrary external programs.
